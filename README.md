# CIS 5660 Final Project: Procedural Terrarium Generator

As the final project for my Procedural Computer Graphics course at Penn, I will be developing a SideFX Houdini Generator Tool that allows users to create variations of succulents using procedural modeling.

## Design Doc

### Introduction

The motivation behind this project is to utilize the power of proceduralism to replicate naturally occurring phenomena from real-life flora! I was especially drawn to the concept of ___phyllotaxis___, the phenomenon of how leaves or petals are arranged around a stem. Phyllotactic patterns (Fibonacci sequences, Golden Ratio, etc.) can be observed in a variety of plant species, such as succulents, which result in beautiful and fascinating geometric patterns. 

Succulents come in various shapes, sizes, colors, and arrangements, making them an interesting subject for procedural modeling. While there are endless types of succulents, for this project I will focus on the ___echeveria___, a type of succulent known for its "aesthetic" rosette shape.

### Goal
Through this project, I hope to accomplish the following:
1. Develop a procedural modeling tool that generates different variations of succulents, enabling users the creative freedom to create a wide range of succulent species and designs.
2. Continue developing my procedural modeling skills in Houdini, gaining hands-on experience with creating a user-friendly and intuitive tool for 3D artists
3. Create beautiful and realistic final renders of terrariums, populated with succulents (and potentially other greenery like cacti) generated with my Houdini tool.

### Timeline:

#### Week 1 (11/8 - 11/15):
- Implement a working, initial Houdini tool that can generate basic succulent geometry.
  - ex.

#### Week 2 (11/16 - 11/27)
- Continue to refine the succulent generator tool
- If time permits, experiment with the cacti generator tool

#### Week 3 (11/28 - 12/5)
- Create final renders
  - Model different versions of the terrarium containers, including round glass containers and ceramic pots
  - Create different variations of succulents and manually place the succulents into the terrariums
  - Add lighting and apply materials
