# CIS 5660 Final Project: Procedural Terrarium Generator

As the final project for my Procedural Computer Graphics course at Penn, I will be developing a SideFX Houdini Generator Tool that allows users to create variations of succulents using procedural modeling.

## Design Doc

### Introduction

The motivation behind this project is to utilize the power of proceduralism to replicate naturally occurring phenomena from real-life flora! I was especially drawn to the concept of **phyllotaxis**, the phenomenon of how leaves or petals are arranged around a stem. Phyllotactic patterns (Fibonacci sequences, Golden Ratio, etc.) can be observed in a variety of plant species, such as succulents, which result in beautiful and fascinating geometric patterns.

Succulents come in various shapes, sizes, colors, and arrangements, making them an interesting subject for procedural modeling. 

### Goal
The goal of the project is to create a procedural modeling tool in Houdini for generating real-life succulents (and potentially other greenery like cacti and ferns if time permits!) The final result will be renders of terrariums, populated with different variations of succulents generated with the tool. Through this project, I hope to continue developing my procedural modeling skills in Houdini and gain hands-on experience with developing user-friendly tools for 3D artists.
